## Introduction

This project aims to develop a robust and accurate license plate detection model using machine learning techniques. The model is capable of identifying and localizing license plates in various types of images.

## Features

- Accurate detection of license plates in images
- Easy-to-use Jupyter notebook for demonstration
- Supports various image formats
- High performance and scalability

## Installation

To install and run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/license-plate-detection.git
    cd license-plate-detection
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the model, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Navigate to the notebook file `License_Plate_Detection.ipynb` and open it.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the model and run the detection on sample images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled images of vehicles with license plates. You can use any publicly available dataset or collect your own images. Ensure the images are properly annotated for optimal performance.

## Model Architecture

The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. It is designed to detect and localize license plates in images with high accuracy. The details of the architecture and training process are provided in the Jupyter notebook.

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy in detecting license plates. Sample results and performance metrics are included in the Jupyter notebook. Below are some example detections:
